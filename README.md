# Coding Cheatsheets

I found that cheatsheets for a lot of languages on here and other sites are outdated, all over the place or sometimes not that good. I made this to be an up to date and hopefully better and more consolidated location for coding cheatsheets and quick reference. 

Each language is spilt into 2 MD files, one for the fundementals of the language and another for more advanced parts of the language. The latter will be less updated but hopefully they can become somthing of use in the future.

This is under HEAVY development so expect errors or missing things, if you find any please open an issue or make a pull request.
