# Coding Cheatsheets

I found that cheatsheets for a lot of languages on here and other sites are outdated, all over the place or sometimes not that good. I made this to be an up to date and hopefully better and more consolidated location for coding cheatsheets and quick reference. 

Each language is spilt into 2 MD files, one for basic parts that are important for everything else and another for more complicated parts of the language. The latter will be less updated but hopefully they can become somthing of use in the future.
